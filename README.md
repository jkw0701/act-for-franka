# ACTFranka_jkw : Action Chunking with Transformer on Franka 

This Repository provides the [**ACT (Action Chunking with Transfomer)**](https://github.com/tonyzhaozh/act) Algorithms to the **Franka Emika Panda Research Robot Arms** for performing multiple manipulation tasks.
The system was developed for both simulation and real-world environments, and its result was verified through a series of experiments in both settings.

### Credits 
> The Simulation environment was derived from **[ACTfranka](https://github.com/sainavaneet/ACTfranka)**, But several modifications were made to suit our tasks and architecture.
> Special thanks to the original contributors for their foundational work.
