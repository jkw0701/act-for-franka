# ACTFranka_jkw : Action Chunking with Transformer on Franka Panda

This Repository provides the [**ACT (Action Chunking with Transfomer)**](https://github.com/tonyzhaozh/act) Algorithms to the **Franka Emika Panda Research Robot Arms** for performing multiple manipulation tasks.
The system was developed for both simulation and real-world environments, and its result was verified through a series of experiments in both settings.

### Credits 
> The Simulation environment was derived from **[ACTfranka](https://github.com/sainavaneet/ACTfranka)**, But several modifications were made to suit our tasks and architecture.
>
> 
> Special thanks to the original contributors for their foundational work.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure the following tools and hardware system are available.

* **Operating System** - [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)
* **ROS1 Noetic** - For robot communication and control
* **Gazebo** - Simulation environment
* **NUC PC** - For real-time robot control and computation
* **Joystick** - For teleoperation control
* **Cameras**
  > **2** x <ins>Intel RealSense L515</ins> (RGB Only) - Left and right viewpoints\
  > **1** x <ins>Intel RealSense D435</ins> (RGB)- Mounted on gripper for close-up viewpoints

  **`Optional Tools`**
  
  * **Conda Virtual Environment** - Recommended for managing dependencies cleanly
  * **Text Editor** e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
